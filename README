Commons fair use upload bot re-uploads files that are deleted on
Commons to projects where they are in use, if those projects accept
non-free files. For details see:

https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Commons_fair_use_upload_bot

Requires mwclient (tested with 0.6.5), available from:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/mwclient/

Add the directory containing the unpacked mwclient directory to your
PYTHONPATH.

It also requires a credentials file called
Commons_fair_use_upload_bot.credentials.txt of the form:

[mwclient]
username=Bot username
password=Bot password

On Toolserver, I run it regularly with the following cronie line:

46 * * * * cronsub -s Commons_fair_use_upload_bot PYTHONPATH=$HOME $HOME/Commons_fair_use_upload_bot/Commons_fair_use_upload_bot.py >> $HOME/Commons_fair_use_upload_bot/Commons_fair_use_upload_bot.out
