Commons fair use upload bot re-uploads files that are deleted on
Commons to projects where they are in use, if those projects accept
non-free files. For details see:

https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Commons_fair_use_upload_bot

It requires a file called Commons_fair_use_upload_bot.credentials.txt
of the form:

[mwclient]
username=Bot username
password=Bot password

On Toolserver, I run it regularly with the following cronie line:

46 * * * * cronsub -s Commons_fair_use_upload_bot $HOME/Commons_fair_use_upload_bot/Commons_fair_use_upload_bot.py >> $HOME/Commons_fair_use_upload_bot/Commons_fair_use_upload_bot.out
